## About
The CSS Background Generator is a project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic, user-friendly interface for generating CSS gradients. 

The HTML structure includes two color inputs for users to select colors, and a display area where the generated CSS code for the background gradient is shown.

The CSS file contains the styling for the HTML elements.

The JavaScript file adds interactivity to the page. It listens for changes to the color inputs, and updates the background of the page and the displayed CSS code in real time.

## How to Use
1. Open the CSS Background Generator in your web browser.
2. Use the color inputs to select two colors for your gradient.
3. As you change the colors, the background of the page will update to show the gradient, and the CSS code for the gradient will be displayed on the page.
4. You can copy the CSS code and use it in your own projects!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
